# Changelog

Notable changes to `libtmux`.

Every release so far is an **alpha**: a prerelease, published under both the
`latest` and `alpha` dist-tags, whose API can change between versions without a
deprecation cycle. Semantic versioning starts applying at `0.1.0`.

<!-- KEEP THIS PLACEHOLDER: new work lands under "Unreleased" until a release is cut. -->

## Unreleased

## 0.0.1-alpha.6

### Fixed

Three unit files each rebuilt `dist` while the suite was running four files at
a time, and `build` begins by deleting it — so tests that read the emitted
package could observe it missing, which is what turned CI red twice. The build
now happens once, before any test runs.

A fixture marker was read as soon as it existed rather than once it held
anything, so a PID that was mid-write was rejected as invalid.

### Documentation

Install instructions name the published package rather than telling readers to
clone the repository, and every link, shell command and recipe in the
documentation is now checked on each run — a recipe marked as runnable has to
be a literal excerpt of an example the integration suite executes.

## 0.0.1-alpha.5

### What's new

#### Typed control of tmux, with a snapshot at its centre

`Server.snapshot()` reads the whole server in one round of commands and returns
sessions, windows, panes, and clients already related to each other. Everything
reachable from the result resolves locally and never changes, so a value read
from it cannot shift underneath the code holding it.

Queries are declarative. `Selection.where()` takes criteria that are data —
equality, string operators, `AND`/`OR`/`NOT`, regular expressions as
`{ pattern, flags }`, and quantifiers over relations — while `Selection.filter()`
takes an ordinary predicate. The two are never overloaded into each other.

#### Control-mode streaming

`Server.watch()` holds one `tmux -C` connection open and yields notifications as
a discriminated union, so `event.kind` narrows the rest of the shape with no
cast. A notification this release does not model arrives as
`{ kind: "unknown", name, args }` rather than being dropped.

`Server.connect()` routes commands over that same connection, so a snapshot
costs four writes instead of four processes. Each `subscribe()` is an
independent view with its own buffer, and `waitFor()` subscribes before it reads
so a change landing in between is still seen. `ready()` resolves once tmux has
accepted the attach — await it before making the change you mean to observe,
since a control client is told nothing that happened before it attached.

#### Environments, buffers, and the escape hatch

Session and server environments are readable and writable, modelling the three
states tmux distinguishes: a value, `null` for a variable marked for removal
from child processes, and absent. `loadBuffer` feeds tmux's stdin, so a payload
too large or too binary for a command-line argument arrives whole.

`cmd()` runs any tmux command through the same socket, deadline, and error
handling as everything else, so a command this package does not model never
means building a subprocess.

### Compatibility

Requires tmux 3.2a or newer, and Node 22+ or Bun 1.3.14+. The format registry
withholds newer fields from an older server. CI runs the suite against 3.2a,
3.7 and 3.7b on every commit; `test:compat` sweeps a wider local matrix.

One behaviour differs across the range rather than being gated: tmux 3.3a
suppressed `run-shell` output for an invocation with no attached client, which
later versions restored. `runShell` returns an empty result there rather than
failing.

### Dependencies

None. The package installs a tmux client and nothing else — no transitive tree
to audit, pin, or deduplicate. Validation of tmux's own output lives in a small
internal validator whose failures carry the value that failed.
